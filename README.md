# HELLO!
Welcome to one of my repos on GitHub, CodeDumpspace.

As the name goes, this is just a repository for me to dump both useful and useless pieces of code that I write

I will also be using this repository to store all my Code Assignments and stuff I do in my free time in the Computer lab [VTU]

**(The Assignments are mostly Eclipse Projects, and its gonna stay like that till i make a dedicated final source folder inside the assignment folder)**
## Anyhoo,
See Ya later

                                                                    -BastaMasta
